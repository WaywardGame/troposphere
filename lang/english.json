				"The wind rushed {hasHair?through my hair:over my bald head} and my heart raced as my nimbus flew through the clouds. After a few minutes, I arrived in a magical place miles above the ground which I am dubbing the \"troposphere\". At first I was nervous about how the clouds could be holding my weight, but my curiosity and my want of adventure got the better of me. At that point I decided that it's not worth it to dwell on such trivial things.\n\nAlthough the troposphere is beautiful and peaceful at first glance, it is likely a facade. My survival thus far, and the instincts I have accrued, have taught me to prepare for a challenge. I should not underestimate my surroundings: It wasn't long ago that I was losing to giant rats, writing publically about my negative experience, and then having my readers scoff at my ineptitude."

You can ascend and descend using the \"Fly\" action available from the {link(Menu.HelpArticle.Actions):item menu} of nimbus items.\n\nThe durability of nimbus items is limited, so make sure to conserve its use or craft new ones using a mixture of feathers, cloudstones, and snowflakes, all of which can be found in the troposphere layer.\n\nBe careful with holes in the clouds. The landing can be painful!"
